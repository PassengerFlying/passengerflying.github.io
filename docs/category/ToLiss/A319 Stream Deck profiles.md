title: ToLiss A319 Stream Deck profiles
---
# Instructions
### Stream Deck
- [[../docs/Overview of the keys|Overview of the keys]]
- [[../docs/Titles on SD keys|Title color and size on SD keys]]
- [[../docs/Naming conventions|Naming conventions]]

# Philosophy
I created two profiles for the Stream Deck XL. One that shows keys per flight phase and the other one tries to copy the layout of the Airbus.
I created new graphics for all the keys and I decided not to use any backgrounds. Some flightsim profiles for the Stream Deck try to make the keys look like real keys from the aircraft, but I think the Stream Deck should be treated as a device on its own.
