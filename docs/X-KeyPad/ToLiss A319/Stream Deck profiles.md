title: ToLiss A319 Stream Deck profiles
---
# Instructions
### Stream Deck
- [[./Overview of the keys and encoders|Overview of the keys and encoders]]
- [[./Titles on SD keys|Title color and size on SD keys]]
- [[../Naming conventions|Naming conventions]]

# Philosophy
When creating this profile I had two options for the layout of the keys:
- follow flight phases
- follow the layout of the flightdeck
I went with the latter. Every user will have different preferences on what each flight phase should look like and with the flightdeck setup it's easy to copy/paste whatever you like to any page you like.

Graphics wise I went for new graphics for all the keys. Some flightsim profiles for the Stream Deck try to make the keys look like real keys from the aircraft, but I think the Stream Deck should be treated as a device on its own.

# Requirements

## Software

- Elgato's Streak Deck software, which is available for Windows and Mac, but not for Linux.
- X-KeyPad, [at least version 1.5.1](https://link.passengerflying.com/vqfZ7z)
- X-Plane 11 or 12, Windows or Mac. Linux won't work (see above).

## Hardware
Any Stream Deck will work, but you get most of the fun with at least a Stream Deck XL and then a Stream Deck Plus.

> I only own the [ToLiss A319](https://link.passengerflying.com/G0y26b), but it is very plausible that ToLiss uses the same [[ToLiss Datarefs|datarefs]] for the A321, A320 and A340. This means that some keys might also work for those aircraft.
