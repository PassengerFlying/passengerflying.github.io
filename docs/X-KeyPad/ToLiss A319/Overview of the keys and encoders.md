To add keys to your Stream Deck, you need the function names. A list of keys/encoders and their names in [[X-KeyPad]] is [[./List of keys and their names|here]].

# Stream Deck Plus encoders
## Autopilot
**Main screen**
![[../../images/passengerflying-0001.png|passengerflying-0001.png]]

For all dials:
- `short press`: equal to a `push`
- `long press`: equal to a `pull`
And the `touch taps`:
- `SPD`: toggle between `SPD` and `MACH`
- `HDG`: toggle between `HDG/VS` and `TRK/FPA`
- `ALT`: toggle between `100/1000`. This setting is not visible, just like on the Airbus
- `V/S`: toggle between `HDG/VS` and `TRK/FPA`

**MFD/Baro**
`MFD/Baro` is a folder:
![[../../images/passengerflying-0020.png|passengerflying-0020.png]]

For the `baro`:
- `short press`: toggle `std`
- `long press` and `touch tap`: switch between `inHg` and `hPa`.

The rose is also on this page. It's quite sensitive, but will start again when reaching the end.

## COMs
**On the Stream Deck Plus**
![[../../images/passengerflying-0006.png|passengerflying-0006.png]]

The `dial` will adjust the stand by frequency, which is the lower, dimmed value. A `short press` will toggle between fine and coarse values. A `touch tap` will switch between the two frequencies.

**On other Stream Decks**

## Lights (and baro)

![[../../images/passengerflying-0002.png|passengerflying-0002.png]]![[../../images/passengerflying-0003.png|passengerflying-0003.png]]![[../../images/passengerflying-0004.png|passengerflying-0004.png]]![[../../images/passengerflying-0005.png|passengerflying-0005.png]]

# Stream Deck (all versions) keys
## Elec

![[../../images/passengerflying-0007.png|passengerflying-0007.png]]

Note: `IDG 1` and `IDG 2` will give the correct status, but I still need to figure out how to activate them when pressed.

## Anti-Ice and Lights

![[../../images/passengerflying-0008.png|passengerflying-0008.png]]
`ANN LT` is fully functional. When set to `TEST`, all the lights of all the buttons will turn on.

`EMER EXIT LT` appears twice, the left one is the status light, the right one the switch. You could do with just the switch.

## Engines

![[../../images/passengerflying-0009.png|passengerflying-0009.png]]

The three keys in the first column show the position of the throttle. If you press the one with `TO GA FLX MCT`, the throttle will move up to the next setting. `CL 0` will move you down.
Long press `REV FULL` to toggle reversers on *both* engines.
The blue throttle status is just a smaller version and pushing it does nothing.


## ECAM
![[../../images/passengerflying-0010.png|passengerflying-0010.png]]

The four keys at the top are switches.
`EMER CANC` will only work when long pressing, to simulate the cover.

## HYD/Fuel
![[../../images/passengerflying-0011.png|passengerflying-0011.png]]

**TODO**: Both `ELEC PUMP blue` and `ELEC PUMP yellow` titles are too close to the lights of the keys.


## Air Cond
![[../../images/passengerflying-0012.png|passengerflying-0012.png]]

**TODO**:
- `COCKPIT`
- `FWD CABIN`
- `AFT CABIN`
