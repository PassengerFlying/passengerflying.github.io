When creating or moving pages on the Stream Deck, the software will add `previous page` and `next page` buttons to _each_ page in that profile, even if that will overwrite any keys. Not only that, they will be randomly placed.
You might as well add the maximum amount of pages when you start and make sure you don't rearrange them afterwards.
