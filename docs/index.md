# About SIDS, STARS and other distractions.

## Intro
I created Passenger Flying to collect my experiences with flightsims. It's just for fun, I'm not a very serious flightsimmer. At least not if you compare me to the more proficient flightsimmers out there who know how to set up `VNV`. I learn to fly by trial and error. My level is not like a pilot flying, but more like a *passenger flying*.

So far this site is for the [[Stream Deck]] profile I created for the ToLiss A319. Together with the plugin [[X-KeyPad]] you can use any Stream Deck to control your aircraft.

### Why the name?
When two pilots fly a plane, one is the _pilot flying_ and the other is the _pilot monitoring_. Since I have the experience level of neither, I'd like to think of a situation where the passenger needs to fly the plane and what that would be like. So my designation is _passenger flying_.

### The structure of this site
This is a [Digital Garden](https://link.passengerflying.com/RryLqc), not a blog. It's a collection of notes and they're constantly changing. To create it I use [Obsidian](https://link.passengerflying.com/SBqoRq) and the [Digital Garden plugin](https://link.passengerflying.com/oqH3sF).
