## Software

- Elgato's Streak Deck software, which is available for Windows and Mac, but not for Linux.
- X-KeyPad, [latest beta](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/267658-x-keypad-151-beta/&do=findComment&comment=2555800)
- X-Plane 11 or 12, Windows or Mac. Linux won't work (see above).

## Hardware
Any Stream Deck will work, but you get most of the fun with at least a Stream Deck XL and then a Stream Deck Plus.

I only own the [ToLiss A319](https://bit.ly/3Uyu7zB), but it is very plausible that ToLiss uses the same [[../../../../ToLiss Datarefs|datarefs]] for the A321, A320 and A340. This means that some keys might also work for those aircraft.
