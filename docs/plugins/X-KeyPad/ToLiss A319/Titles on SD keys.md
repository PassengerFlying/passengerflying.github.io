title: ToLiss A319 Titles on SD keys
tags:
  - FFA256
---

It's not possible to set the color and size of titles with [[Elgato's Stream Deck software]]. The touch screen on the [[Stream Deck Plus]] is an exception.

For some keys I have embedded the title in the key image itself, but I'm not finished with all of them yet. For the ones that still use the Stream Deck title, please check this page.

## Color
For the titles of the keys I use color #FFA256. 

## Size
For keys with just one line I use size `10`.

And for two lines `9`.

The buttons for the autopilot have size `15`.
