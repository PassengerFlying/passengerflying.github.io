The three keys in the first column show the position of the throttle. If you press the one with `TO GA FLX MCT`, the throttle will move up to the next setting. `CL 0` will move you down.
Long press `REV FULL` to toggle reversers on *both* engines.
The blue throttle status is just a smaller version and pushing it does nothing.
